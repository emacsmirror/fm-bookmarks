* fm-bookmark.el
  Use existed file managers' bookmarks in Dired.

** Introduce
   If you're using Dired, you may want to directly access existed
   bookmarks in your prefered file manager (e.g. Dolphin, Nautilus,
   PCManFM) via Dired, without any redundant configuration for Dired
   or `balahbalah-bookmarks.el`. If so, =fm-bookmark.el= is just what
   you're looking for.

   =fm-bookmark.el= also has an experimental feature to list mounted
   media (via =mount= shell command, due to the limitation of the crap
   Emacs Lisp).
